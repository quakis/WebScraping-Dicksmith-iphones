Hi thanks for having a look at my WebScraping work.
In this code I have taken a page of iphones from dicksmith and scraped all the phone-names, ratings and prices.
I have then converted them into a csv file so they can be easily viewed in a excel form.
Webpage that was scraped: https://www.dicksmith.co.nz/dn/shop/phones/iphone/?page=1
